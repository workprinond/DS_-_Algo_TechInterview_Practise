    Sort both list of routes by their distance, in decreasing order.
    Then discard any route greater than or equal to the maximum travel distance.
    Then, pick the longest route in the forward direction. (Either direction would work here)
    Once you have the longest forward route, go down the list of returning routes (in sorted order),
    and make sure that the distance of the forward route you picked earlier plus the distance of
    the current returning route does not exceed the safe travel distance.
    If you find a pair whose sum does not exceed the safe travel distance, store that as the best
    route pair.
    Keep repeating this process as you go down the current list of returning routes. Once you've
    performed this process for all return routes for the given forward route you chose, move
    on to the next longest route. If the distance of the forward route plus the distance of the
    return route do not exceed the length of the best distance, then keep going (remember that the routes are sorted!)
